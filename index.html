<p clear id="p1" style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;"> Worldwide, there has been a big issue about poor eating habits. 
    In recent years, multiple children have gotten malnourished due to poverty, or not having access to healthy food. This may cause damage to the child’s body and affect their mental mind. There have also been recent cases about children getting overweight, this is because of consuming too much fast foods, sugary drinks and lacking in physical exercise. Children who are obese could potentially suffer from diabetes and or heart diseases.
 </p>
 <p clear id="p2" style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;"> Those who suffer from poor eating habits at a young age, if they aren’t willing to take care of themselves then the effects of this issue can carry onto adulthood. Unfortunately, it isn’t just the children who are hurt from this problem, there are even adults and teens. Some may develop an eating disorder, which includes, anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating. The reason one could get this disorder are because of pressures about body image, struggles with mental health, and misinformation about food. Without enough nutrients, it won't only just weaken your body but also affects energy levels, mood, and concentration, which makes finishing everyday tasks difficult.

<p id="f" clear style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Currently, governments, health agencies and organizations are putting effort to end this problem.  Public health agencies like the National Nutrition Council (NNC), UNICEF, and WHO are advocating for stronger food policies like,  front-of-package labeling, sugar regulation, and restrictions on marketing unhealthy foods to children. There also have been schools and communities organizing  nutrition programs which can help improve access to healthy food, building healthy eating habits early, and they can spread awareness to bigger groups. 
</p>
<p id="s" style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Donations from people and organizations play a role in addressing eating disorders as the money can be used to support tons of solutions. These include the developing new treatment programs, funding for mental health research, and running campaigns that’ll help spread awareness to educate as many people about the dangers of eating disorders.</p>
<p id="t" style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">
	As a student, my role in the community will be to promote healthy eating habits and to raise awareness. I can start by educating myself and others about how healthy and balanced meals are important, how dangerous it is to have an unhealthy diet, and the signs of eating disorders. I can also support programs or campaigns by either volunteering, fundraising, or promoting them. By being knowledgeable and aware, I can assist in making a healthy and supportive environment.
